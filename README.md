# JOGL and Java

## Introduction

The practical work for com3503/com4503/com6503 will inolve creating an interactive 3D Computer Graphics program using Java and JOGL. The material given below will teach you how to install and use JOGL. Installation instructions are given for both Windows and Mac.

Whilst OpenGL has been superceded by other developments, there is still a lot of software that uese OpenGL and learning OpenGL still gives you insights into the interplay between the CPU and the GPU when developing graphics software. Also, of the modern APIs available, the development path means quick results can be obtained.
