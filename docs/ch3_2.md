## 3.2 Dynamically changing the VBO data
 
This section can be skipped if you wish, as we will not make use of this feature in subsequent chapters.

This example shows how to change the data for a vertex whilst the program is running. This could be done by (i) changing the vertex data for one or more vertices on the CPU and then sending all the vertex data to the GPU for each iteration of the display loop, or (ii) sending all the vertex data once and then 'reaching over' to the GPU and altering the data for some (or all) of the vertices on the GPU during the display loop. The second option means that we don't have to keep sending all the data (although we still have to send the changed data). Figure 3.6 illustrates the results of changing all the vertex positions over time. A similar approach could be used to change a subset of a collection of vertices. (We'll see in later chapters that we instead use matrices to manipulate, i.e. transform, collections of vertices for 3D objects.)
