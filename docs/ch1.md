# Chapter 1. Introduction

Before you start, you need to install JOGL. See [Appendix A: Installing JOGL](appendixA.md) to do this.

This tutorial will focus on modern OpenGL using Java and JOGL. There are relatively few resources on this in comparison to the more plentiful resources on OpenGL and C/C++. However, all the OpenGL and C/C++ resources are useful, since they still explain the OpenGL aspects. Rather than explain many of those aspects in this tutorial, I will instead make use of an excellent existing tutorial: [Joey de Vries's Learn OpenGL tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/).

In some of the chapters, I will ask you to read the relevant section in Joey's tutorial. This will explain the new OpenGL ideas. I will then explain how to achieve similar things using Java and JOGL. This way I can focus on the Java and JOGL aspects rather than re-explain the OpenGL aspects. It is thus important that you read the relevant parts of Joey's tutorial first.

Links to my Java and JOGL code will be given in each chapter.

Screenshots of programs will be used in each chapter to show what you should see when you run each program. The colours on your screen may be slightly different, depending on how your monitor is set up.

I do not advocate a specific editor to develop your programs. I have used Visual Studio Code when developing all the source code for the tutorial. When you hand in the assessed work for the module it must be possible to compile and run your program from the command line in a command window rather than have to rely on a specific IDE (which I may not have installed).

[!TIP]
Clicking on any of the links in a github markdown file will open the new file in place of the existing one. Thus, if you want the link to open in a new tab, then use ctrl+click (on Windows) or CMD+click (on MacOS) to open the link.
