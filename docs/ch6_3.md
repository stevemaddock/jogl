## 6.3 Texture

So far, we have used ambient, diffuse, specular and shininess values in calculating a fragment's final colour. Now we will make use of colour bitmaps (textures) to alter the rendering of the objects. Figure 6.x shows an example, where a cube looks like a container made of wood with a pattern of light overlaid on the wood and with shiny metal edges to the container. THis is achieved by the use of a diffuse map, a specular map and an emission map. We'll make use of the TextureLibrary class from Chapter 4.

### 6.3.1 Texture maps

These are stored in bitmap files. .jpg or .png can be used in the programs. These are usually a power of 2 in size in each dimension, e.g. 256x256. Figure 6.x shows the three texture maps used to produce the rendering of the container.
