# 2.1 Creating a drawing surface

The aim of this starting program is to run through the Java Swing code needed to open a window and create a drawing surface. Program Listings 2.1-2.3 (A01.java) open a window and attach an OpenGL canvas and event listener. Nothing is drawn on the canvas area at this stage (Figure 2.4). However, this program can be used to check that you have set up the relevant system programming environment paths for JOGL (see Appendix A) and thus the program compiles. We'll use this program to explain some of the housekeeping associated with setting up a window - this code will appear in many of your future programs. (Note: the download files - A01.java and A01_GLEventListener.java - have some extra explanatory comments in the code.)

##  2.1.1 Importing Java packages

First, a number of packages need to be imported (see Program Listing 2.1). These give access to the OpenGL API and also the standard Java routines for creating a window and detecting events on that window (e.g. the window closing event, triggered, for example, in Microsoft Windows by clicking on the cross at the right end of the window title bar). If you don't know how to use Java AWT and Java Swing, then you will need to do some background reading, as I will be focussing on the OpenGL aspects. For now, you can just reuse the same code in each of your programs.

```
  import java.awt.BorderLayout;
  import java.awt.Dimension;
  import java.awt.event.WindowAdapter;
  import java.awt.event.WindowEvent;
  import javax.swing.JFrame;
  import com.jogamp.opengl.GLAutoDrawable;
  import com.jogamp.opengl.GLCapabilities;
  import com.jogamp.opengl.GLProfile;
  import com.jogamp.opengl.GLEventListener;
  import com.jogamp.opengl.awt.GLCanvas;
  import com.jogamp.opengl.util.FPSAnimator;

  public class A01 extends JFrame {
    // ...
  }
```

Program Listing 2.1: Part of A01.java: Importing packages

I have separately listed individual classes in the import statements. An alternative is to use `java.awt.*` and `java.awt.event.*` and `com.jogamp.opengl.*` and `com.jogamp.opengl.util.*` and so on. The use of the wildcard `.*` will mean that the compiler will then decide which classes need to be imported based on the rest of the program code in this file.

To create the window, we use Java Swing's `JFrame` class. The main class `A01` extends the `JFrame` class, so the code to create the frame is inherited when the constructor is called (see Program Listing 2.2).

```
public class A01 extends JFrame {
private static final int WIDTH = 1024;
private static final int HEIGHT = 768;
private static final Dimension dimension = new Dimension(WIDTH, HEIGHT);

private GLCanvas canvas;
private GLEventListener glEventListener;

private final FPSAnimator animator;

public static void main(String[] args) {
  A01 f = new A01("A01");
  f.getContentPane().setPreferredSize(dimension);
  f.pack();
  f.setVisible(true);
}

public A01(String textForTitleBar) {
  // ...
}
```
